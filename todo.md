1. Error handling(if not done already). Instruct claude(or do this yourself) to display cards with null values for the current search criteria at the bottom of the list instead of the top as its currently doing.

2. Make cards only display one per row instead of the current three.
    a. Adjust Aspect ratio to be roughly 12 x 4 -ish instead of the current sizing. 
    b. Figure out how to make sure text doesnt exceed the bounds of the cards.
    c. Ensure the image placeholder is always a square aspect ratio no matter what, as right now it is getting stretched/squeezed.
    d. Fill out images with actual images,
3. Ignore null rows 
4. If youre are feeling adventuous, try to create a pop up so if the user clicks on a card, it opens a pop up with the same sort of visuals that you had in rshiny.
